Farmers in the U.S. have an average age of 59 years old, and while 85% [1] of them have cell phones that can truly revolutionize their work, the industry still lags in adopting advanced technology. Machine learning and data-driven solutions are started booming in all fields [2], we can use this ideal opportunity to fill the gap with new emerging ideas. 

*Problem Statement:*
The agriculture industry struggles with a significant gap in technology adoption, particularly in rural and underdeveloped regions. Farmers face several critical issues, including improper soil management, poor crop selection, and unpredictable climate conditions, which directly affect productivity and profit. Existing tools and solutions fail to provide a holistic approach, addressing only one specific problems while neglecting others.due to the removal of an assured MSP by the government via Farmers Act 2020

The approach is to develop an Android mobile application that tries to fill the stated gap by providing an end-to-end solution that helps both new farmers as well as experienced farmers who have been looking for progressive, helpful ways to improve their businesses. The main features of this application includes soil and crop detection, climate-based crop choices, mixed farming techniques, and live updates. These features will help farmers make use of the technology and make better decisions for efficient and profitable benefits with their land.

Our features of this application includes five steps to help farmers make use of the technology and make better decisions for efficient and profitable benefits with their land. The five features in the application are:

- Soil Detection
- Crop Suggestions
- Disease Detection
- Farm Community Forum
